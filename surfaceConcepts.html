        <div id="content1" class="content-placeholder">
            <p>Data refers to a collection of facts in their raw, unprocessed form—such as numbers, characters, or observations. Data alone may not be immediately meaningful, as it represents basic inputs or elements without context or structure. Information, on the other hand, is created when data is organized, cleaned for errors, and processed in a way that makes it clear, meaningful, and ready to use for a specific purpose. This transformation turns data into something useful, making it easier to interpret, measure, or visualize. Knowledge emerges from analyzing and understanding this information; it represents insights drawn from patterns and trends within data. Knowledge enables deeper understanding and is often used to make informed decisions, solve problems, or guide future strategies, particularly in fields like marketing, where insights into customer behavior and market trends can drive successful campaigns and initiatives (Ontotext Fundamentals, 2018). 
            </p>
            <p>With the context of data being the collection of raw facts and information, this is transformed into information by the use of various processes dependent on the type of information tasked to be analyzed, this is done through processes like organization, filtering, and analysis. Raw data is transformed into structured information that reveals patterns, trends, or summaries. These methods, which can include statistical analysis, data visualization, and categorization, convert unstructured data into a format that’s easier to understand and apply.
            </p>
            <p>This structured information, when further analyzed, leads to knowledge—an understanding developed by identifying correlations, cause-effect relationships, and potential predictions. This knowledge then supports informed decision-making and strategic planning, turning raw data into insights that can be applied practically across fields like business, science, and beyond (dparente, 2023). Once organized, information can be further examined to develop knowledge—an understanding that emerges by identifying correlations, cause-effect relationships, and potential patterns. This knowledge then empowers informed decision-making and strategic planning, transforming raw data into valuable insights that can be applied practically across fields like business, science, and beyond (Hutchinson, 2024). 
            </p>
            <p>Raw, unprocessed information like employee clock-in times, consumer purchase records, or website click logs are referred to as data in real-world contexts. For instance, a retail establishment gathers sales receipts that list the products, date, and time of purchase. This data turns into information when it is arranged into a sales report that highlights top-selling items and summarizes daily income. Knowledge is created by further examining this data to find trends, such as the fact that some products sell better on weekends or during particular times of the year.

        <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent('content5')">5. Common Number Systems in Computing</a>
        <div id="content5" class="content-placeholder">
            <p>The common number systems used in computing include decimal (Base-10), binary (Base-2), octal (Base-8), and hexadecimal (Base-16). These systems are used in computing, mathematics, and digital systems for various applications. The conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal happen by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Binary to Decimal:</strong>
                    <p>Start from the rightmost digit of the binary number. Multiply each digit by 2 raised to the power of its position. Add the results to get the decimal value.</p>
                    <p>Example: 1010 (binary) → 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 0×2⁰ = 10 (decimal).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Decimal to Binary:</strong>
                    <p>Divide the decimal number by 2. Record the remainder. Repeat the division with the quotient until it reaches 0. The binary equivalent is the remainders read in reverse order.</p>
                    <p>Example: 10 (decimal) → 1010 (binary).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Binary to Hexadecimal:</strong>
                    <p>Group binary digits in sets of 4, starting from the right. Convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.</p>
                    <p>Example: 1010 (binary) → A (hexadecimal).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hexadecimal to Binary:</strong>
                    <p>Convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.</p>
                    <p>Example: A (hexadecimal) → 1010 (binary).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The binary system is essential for computers because they operate using electrical signals that have two distinct states: on (1) and off (0). This aligns perfectly with binary (Base-2), where 1 represents "true" or "on," and 0 represents "false" or "off." This simplicity allows computers to process and store data efficiently using binary logic.</p>
